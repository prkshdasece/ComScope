## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Snap Store (Easiest for All Distributions)

ComScope is available on Snap Store for all Linux distributions.

> **⚠️ Note:** On classic Linux, the snap must be installed in `--devmode` to access serial ports like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`

```bash
# Install
sudo snap install comscope --devmode

# Run
comscope

# Update
sudo snap refresh comscope --devmode

# Remove
sudo snap remove comscope
```

**Supported Architectures:** x86_64, ARM 64-bit (arm64), ARM 32-bit (armhf)

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Starting ComScope

```bash
comscope          # From Snap or system-wide installation
./ComScope        # From build directory
```

### Workflow Overview

ComScope guides you through three simple steps:

#### Step 1️⃣ — Select Serial Port

Use arrow keys to choose your device, then press Enter:

```
ComScope -- Select a port
  ▸ /dev/ttyUSB0
    /dev/ttyUSB1
    /dev/ttyACM0

up/down=select   Enter=connect   q=quit
```

**Controls:**
- **↑/↓** — Navigate port list
- **Enter** — Connect to selected port
- **q** — Exit application

#### Step 2️⃣ — Configure Connection

Preset for standard embedded devices (customizable):

```
ComScope -- Connection Settings
Port: /dev/ttyUSB0

Baud rate  : 115200
Data bits  : 8
Parity     : None
Stop bits  : 1

Tab=next   left/right=change   Enter=connect   q=back
```

**Default Settings:**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Baud Rate | 115200 (adjustable) |
| Data Bits | 8 |
| Parity | None |
| Stop Bits | 1 |

**Controls:**
- **Tab** — Move to next field
- **←/→** — Adjust baud rate
- **Enter** — Establish connection
- **q** — Return to port selection

#### Step 3️⃣ — Monitor & Interact

Once connected, receive real-time data:

```
Hello from Arduino
Ready for commands
Temperature: 25.5°C
Voltage: 4.95V
```

Simply type and press Enter to send commands to your device.

---

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Session Logging

Record all communications with timestamps for debugging and documentation:

1. Press **Ctrl+A** during active session
2. Press **l** to enable logging
3. Data saves to `session.txt` with timestamps
4. Press **Ctrl+A** + **l** again to stop logging

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Snap Installation Issues

**Problem:** `snapd has no serial-port interface slots`

**Cause:** ComScope installed with strict confinement (no hardware access)

**Solution:** Reinstall in developer mode:
```bash
sudo snap remove comscope
sudo snap install comscope --devmode
```

---

### Build from Source Issues

**Problem:** `Permission denied` when opening port

**Cause:** User lacks permission to access `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`

**Solution 1 (Temporary):**
```bash
sudo ./ComScope
```

**Solution 2 (Permanent):**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
# Log out and log back in
```

---

**Problem:** "No ports found"

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Device not connected → Check USB cable and connection
- Device powered off → Turn on your device
- Wrong USB port → Try different USB port on computer
- Missing drivers → Install device-specific drivers
- Manual port check:
  ```bash
  ls -la /dev/tty*
  ```

---

**Problem:** Text appears garbled or colors are wrong

**Solution:**
- Verify terminal supports color output
- Try different terminal emulator (GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm)
- Check terminal type:
  ```bash
  echo $TERM
  ```

---

**Problem:** Application crashes unexpectedly

**Solution:**
- Ensure device remains connected
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting device
- Report with terminal output on GitHub Issues
